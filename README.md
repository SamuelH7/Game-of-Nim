# Game-of-Nim

# About this project
This project is the result of a coding exercise with the following instructions: 

"Write a C++-program which simulates 100 games and prints the number of games won by each player. The players should follow different strategies when choosing a pile and the number of stones to remove:

- One player should choose a non empty pile randomly. If the chosen pile contains one stone, he takes that stone. Otherwise, he takes one or two stones with equal probability.

- The other player takes two stones from the pile with the smallest number of stones. If the chosen pile only contains one stone, he take that one."

# Using the project
The project was made with Visual Studio and can be run by downloading it and, with Visual Studio installed double-clicking the "Game of Nim.sln" file.    

The project can then be run by going to the solution explorer (Ctrl + W) and navigating to the "Program.cs" file and using the the green "Game of Nim" button.
